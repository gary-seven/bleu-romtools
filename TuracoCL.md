#Command line version of Turaco


# Introduction #

Turaco CL is the command line version of the Turaco/Age series of tools.

It converts from ROM data files to PCX image files and back again.  It
is intended that you edit the PCX files in your favorite graphics
editing tool.

These are example image files generated from "Pac-Man" romset.

Turaco CL also generates a "checkerboard file", which you can use
to refer to the index numbers for each character or sprite, as well
as to maintain alignment of character boundaries while you edit
them.
