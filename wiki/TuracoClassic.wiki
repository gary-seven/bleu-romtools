Turaco was a GUI-based editor for graphics ROMs from old arcde machines
with sprite-based hardware such as Pengo, Pac-Man, Rush'n Attack, and such.

It also allowed for mouse-based editing of the rom.  You could select a 
sprite in the ROM, edit it, and use various graphics manipulations.

It also had the facilities to show you how an animation sequence 
will look within the target game.

Turaco Classic is no longer supported or maintained, but the 
downloads tab above will bring you to a few MS-DOS downloads 
of two versions of the software.

  * 0.6.3 is a working version of the application, and the last one made with integrated drivers. (no external driver files necessary)
  * 0.7 is slightly updated and has external driver "INI" files, making it more easily expandable.
