#ROM file builder

= Introduction =

[Genroms] is a tool to build ROM image files to be burned out to actual 
ROM devices, or to be used in emulators.  

It takes in a ".roms" file which describes the memory architecture of the
ROM space, as well as the filenames of the ROMs that are within that space.

It also takes in an Intel Hex File (.IHX) which is a common format that many
assemblers will generate.

Genroms will start with either a ROMspace of zeroes, or from existing
ROM content, then overlay the contents of the IHX data, and save
out new ROM image files.  By allowing the overlay of existing source
ROMs, you can generate easily maintainable, documentable, and
reproducable patches for existing program ROMs.

Since [Genroms] is currently supported and maintained, you can
download the source from the "Source" tab above.  Any issues, bugs,
or suggestions can be logged via the "Issues" tab above.
