# bleu-romtools

Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/bleu-romtools

This is my branch of Turaco, an arcade graphics editor. I am making some fixes and adding some features for my own purposes. Please do not contact the original author (Scott Lawrence) in regard to this derivitive work. At this time, the original project websites for Turaco and Arcade Graphics Editor are still live and should be consulted for the background information for this project.
